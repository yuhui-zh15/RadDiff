# Applications

Details about each individual application below. NOTE: results may not match perfectly to the paper but the top hypotheses and scores should be similar. 

## Datasets

We apply RadDiff on the following tasks in our applications:
- [Survival Analysis](./survival_analysis/)
- [Covid Analysis](./covid_analysis/)
- [Race Analysis](./race_analysis/)

We utilize [MIMIC-CXR](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.1.0/) and [MIMIC-IV] to craft the datasets needed.

Note that we generate the race analysis datasets by bootstrapping images that a ViT can confidently and correctly classify. These images can be generated by running [train_race_vit](race_analysis/train_race_vit.py).

To prepare the data for each application: (1) download the dataset (2) replace the data path in an `.env` file (3) run the `create_[application]_dataset.py` file in the subfolder of each application. Then the experiments can be run in a similar fashion with a config file and a sweep function.
